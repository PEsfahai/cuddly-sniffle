🌟 PRODUCT BRIEF — PANTRI: The Smart Home Food Management App
1. Product Summary

Pantri is an intelligent iOS-based food management platform that helps households track everything in their kitchen—fridge, pantry, freezer—reduce food waste, maximise savings, improve nutrition, and simplify cooking.

Using a combination of barcode scanning, computer vision, OCR, and AI-powered planning, Pantri automatically tracks what food you have, when it expires, what you can cook with it, and where you should shop to save the most money.

Pantri becomes the central operating system for the modern kitchen.

🧭 2. Product Vision

To create the world’s most intuitive and intelligent home food ecosystem—one that dramatically reduces food waste, saves households money, improves eating habits, and eliminates the daily friction of managing food.

Pantri’s vision:
A kitchen that manages itself.

Where:

Food is always used before it expires

Shopping lists build themselves

Recipes match what you have

Prices are compared automatically

You never forget what’s in your fridge again

You waste less and save more, effortlessly

🎯 3. The Problem

Modern households face multiple daily inefficiencies:

A. Food Waste

Households throw away 20–30% of their food.

Main causes:

Forgetting what’s in the fridge

Food expiring without noticing

Overbuying

Poor meal planning

B. Lack of Inventory Awareness

People don’t know:

What they already have

What’s expiring

How much of something is left

C. Meal Planning Stress

“What should I cook today?”

Too many recipes require ingredients not at home

No link between what’s expiring and what to cook

D. Grocery Shopping Inefficiency

Prices vary widely between supermarkets

No tool helps optimise entire baskets across retailers

Shoppers overpay without realising

E. Nutrition is hard to manage

No easy way to track nutrition of home-cooked meals

Meal prep requires manual effort

Diet adherence fails due to lack of planning
